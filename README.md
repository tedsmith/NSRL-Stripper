# NSRL-Stripper
A simple utility for stripping out just the SHA-1 hashes, or just the MD5 hashes or just the CRC hashes alone from the NSRLFile.txt NSRL hash database. 
It generates a text file containing just the hashes of your choice, suitable for ingestion into forensic tools (X-Ways Forensics usually intelligently works it out for you anyway, but if not, you can use this).
